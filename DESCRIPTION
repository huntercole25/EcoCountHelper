Description: This package is tailored to comparing and interpretting models 
    generated using glmmTMB that describe trends in count data. The functions available 
    in the package work best with data that is long-form in terms of experimental units, 
    and wide form in terms of response variables (e.g., site-nights as rows, and species 
    counts as columns). From comparing candidate models for multiple response variables 
    at a time to visualizing modelled effects, this package will facilitate the processes 
    necessary to understand what your models are telling you about the data.
