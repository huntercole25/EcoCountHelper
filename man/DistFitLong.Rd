\title{Visually examine the mean-variance relationship of data}
\usage{
DistFitLong(Splitters, Data, CountCol, GroupCol, GroupList, ThemeBlack = T)

DistFitWide(Splitters, Data, GroupList, ThemeBlack = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{Splitters}{A character vector of column names to aggregate data by.}

\item{Data}{The unquoted name of the data frame or data table containing the raw data models are based on.}

\item{CountCol}{A character string specifying the name of the vector containing count data.}

\item{GroupCol}{A character string specifying the name of the vector containing group information (e.g., order, species) for each observation.}

\item{GroupList}{A character vector of column names representing groups that define model membership (e.g., species, demographics).}

\item{ThemeBlack}{A logical value indicating whether the plots generated should include \code{\link{theme_nocturnal}}
(T) or not (F).}
}
\value{
These functions produces a mean/variance plot with NB1, NB2, and Poisson family function lines for
each group in the vector supplied to the \code{GroupList} argument. Each resultant plot is named with
the group name followed by "DistPlot" (e.g., the plot associated with a group named "Epfu" would be named
"EpfuDistPlot".)
}
\description{
These functions plot data by group, and overlay lines representing three family functions that are
commonly used for count data: NB1, NB2, and Poisson. For more information on this, please reference
