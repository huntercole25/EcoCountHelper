\title{Scale data by two standard deviations}
\usage{
scale2(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector to be scaled.}
}
\description{
This function is very similar to the \code{\link[base]{scale}} function in that it centers 
and scales data, but scaling is accomplished by dividing the centered data by two standard 
deviations rather than one as detailed in Gelman (2008).
