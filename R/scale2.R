#' Scale data by two standard deviations
#' 
#' This function is very similar to the \code{\link[base]{scale}} function in that it centers 
#' and scales data, but scaling is accomplished by dividing the centered data by two standard 
#' deviations rather than one as detailed in Gelman (2008).
#' 
#' @param x A vector to be scaled.
